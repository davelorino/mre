Title: Calculate the Most Relevant Explanation of a Bayesian Network
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Davide Lorino
Maintainer: Davide Lorino <davelorino@gmail.com>
Description: The MRE of a Bayesian Network is proposed by Changhe Yuan and colleagues as an approximate inference algorithm for discovering the partial instantiation of nodes in a Bayesian network which achieves the highest Generalized Bayes Factor. 
    The Generalized Bayes Factor is importantly different from a conventional Bayes Factor in that it represents the odds of a hypothesis given some evidence relative to the absence of that evidence, and compares this metric across the full combinatorial set of potential hypotheses.
    Because calculating Generalized Bayes Factor of every possible permutation of nodes and states in a Bayesian network creates a super-exponential search space, the Hierarchical Beam Search is proposed by the authors of the original method. 
    This package is currently the first open-source solution to implementing the Most Relevant Explanation algorithm through Hierarchical Beam Search.
